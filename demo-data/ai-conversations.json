        "content": "✅ **Notice Analysis Complete**\n\nI've analyzed the denial letter (thompson_snap_denial_letter.pdf). Let me explain it in plain language:\n\n**DENIAL REASON:**\n\"Gross monthly income ($5,200) exceeds maximum income limit ($1,580) for household size 1\"\n\n**What This Means:**\nEmily makes too much money to qualify for SNAP. Here's why:\n\n**The Numbers:**\n- Emily's monthly income: $5,200 (software developer salary)\n- SNAP income limit for 1 person: $1,580/month\n- She earns **329% of the limit** (more than 3× too high)\n\n**Why She Doesn't Qualify:**\nSNAP has a \"gross income test\" - even before any deductions, your income can't be more than 130% of poverty level. Emily's income is 345% of poverty level.\n\n**Could Deductions Help?**\nNo. Even with maximum deductions:\n- Standard deduction: $198\n- 20% earned income: $1,040\n- Student loan interest: Not a SNAP deduction\n- Her net income would still be ~$4,000/month\n- Net limit is only $1,215/month\n\n**Appeal Rights:**\nThe notice says she has **90 days to appeal**, but an appeal won't change the math - she's clearly over the income limits.\n\n**Alternative Resources for Emily:**\n- Emergency food pantries (no income limits)\n- Employer benefits/assistance programs\n- She doesn't qualify for public assistance at this income level\n\n**Bottom Line:** This is a correct denial. Young professionals with no dependents rarely qualify for SNAP unless unemployed or significantly underemployed.\n\nDoes Emily need referrals to food pantries, or was she just checking eligibility?",
