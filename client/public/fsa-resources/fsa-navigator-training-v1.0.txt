Benefits of FSA:
✓ Empowers taxpayers to understand their taxes
✓ Scales VITA services to more people
✓ Reduces preparer burden on volunteers
✓ Available 24/7 (support during business hours)
✓ Taxpayers learn valuable financial literacy

KEY FEATURES NAVIGATORS SHOULD KNOW
✓ Auto-Save: TaxSlayer saves progress every few minutes (taxpayer can log out/in)
✓ Help Tooltips: Hover over "?" for explanations (encourage use!)
✓ Error Checking: Software highlights missing info in red
✓ Refund Tracker: Shows estimated refund amount as you go
✓ Print Options: Can print PDF of return for records
✓ Prior Year Import: Can import last year's return (if filed with TaxSlayer)

COMMON SCREEN-BY-SCREEN GUIDANCE

STEP 1: PERSONAL INFORMATION
- Name: Must match Social Security card exactly (including Jr., Sr.)
- SSN: No dashes, just 9 digits (TaxSlayer auto-formats)
- Address: Current mailing address (where IRS will send correspondence)
- Phone: Best contact number (for IRS if needed)
- Email: Valid email for account recovery

Navigator Tip: Stress importance of accuracy - errors delay refunds!

STEP 2: FILING STATUS
- Single: Unmarried on Dec 31
- Married Filing Jointly: Most common for married couples
- Married Filing Separately: Rare, usually worse tax outcome
- Head of Household: Unmarried with qualifying dependent + paid >50% home costs
- Qualifying Surviving Spouse: Widow(er) within 2 years, with dependent

Navigator Tip: Head of Household is often misunderstood. Verify:
  1. Unmarried on Dec 31 (or living apart from spouse last 6 months)
  2. Paid over half the home costs (rent, utilities, food)
  3. Qualifying child lived with them >6 months

STEP 3: DEPENDENTS
- Full Name and SSN required
- Relationship: Child, stepchild, sibling, parent, etc.
- Date of Birth: Determines age-based credits (Child Tax Credit if <17)
- Months Lived With You: Must be >6 months (or all year for foster)
- Did Child Provide Own Support?: Usually "No"

Navigator Tip: "Dependent already claimed" error = someone else claimed them
  Action: Verify who should claim (custodial parent in divorce)

STEP 4: INCOME
W-2 Wage Income (most common):
- Click "Add W-2"
- Enter exactly as shown on form:
  • Box 1: Wages, tips, other compensation
  • Box 2: Federal income tax withheld
  • Boxes 3-6: Social Security and Medicare wages/withholding
  • Boxes 15-17: State income, tax withheld, locality
- Repeat for each W-2 (multiple jobs)

1099 Income (if applicable):
- 1099-INT: Interest income (bank, savings)
- 1099-DIV: Dividend income (stocks)
- 1099-MISC: Miscellaneous income (Box 3 = other income)
- 1099-NEC: Nonemployee compensation (self-employment - FLAG FOR REVIEW!)
- 1099-G: Unemployment compensation
- 1099-R: Retirement distributions (pensions, IRA)

Navigator Tip: Self-employment (1099-NEC) = complex, refer to in-person

STEP 5: DEDUCTIONS
Standard Deduction (90%+ of FSA users):
- $13,850 (Single)
- $27,700 (Married Filing Jointly)
- $20,800 (Head of Household)
- Automatically selected by software

Itemized Deductions (rarely better for low-income):
- Mortgage interest (Form 1098)
- Charitable contributions (receipts required)
- State/local taxes (SALT, $10k cap)
- Medical expenses (>7.5% AGI)

Navigator Tip: Software compares standard vs itemized, picks better option

STEP 6: CREDITS
Earned Income Tax Credit (EIC):
- Largest credit for low-income workers
- Requires qualifying child OR age 25-64 (if no child)
- Software calculates automatically based on income + dependents
- Audit risk if claimed incorrectly - verify eligibility!

Child Tax Credit (CTC):
- $2,000 per child under 17
- Partially refundable ($1,600 Additional Child Tax Credit)
- Income limits apply (phaseout at $200k/$400k)

Other Dependent Credit:
- $500 per qualifying dependent (not child, e.g., elderly parent)

Education Credits:
- American Opportunity Credit: Up to $2,500 (first 4 years college)
- Lifetime Learning Credit: Up to $2,000 (any education)
- Requires Form 1098-T (tuition statement)

Child & Dependent Care Credit:
- Up to $3,000 for one child, $6,000 for two+
- Daycare, after-school, summer camp costs
- Must provide childcare provider's name, address, EIN

Navigator Tip: Education credits often missed - ask "Did you pay tuition?"

STEP 7: REFUND OR PAYMENT
If Refund:
- Direct Deposit (fastest, 10-21 days): Enter bank routing + account number
- Paper Check (slower, 4-6 weeks): Sent to mailing address

If Balance Due:
- Pay Now (bank withdrawal): Authorize IRS to debit account
- Mail Check: Form 1040-V payment voucher
- Payment Plan: IRS installment agreement (if large amount)

Navigator Tip: Verify bank account info CAREFULLY (wrong account = lost refund!)

STEP 8: E-FILE
- Review summary page (errors highlighted)
- Enter 5-digit Self-Select PIN (any 5 numbers except all zeros)
- Spouse also enters PIN (if Married Filing Jointly)
- Click "Submit Return"
- Confirmation screen: "Accepted by IRS" (save/print confirmation!)

Navigator Tip: Rejection common reasons = SSN mismatch, dependent already claimed

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 4: QUALITY REVIEW PROCEDURES FOR SELF-PREPARED RETURNS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHY QUALITY REVIEW MATTERS
- Taxpayers make mistakes (typos, misunderstood questions)
- Incorrect returns delay refunds or trigger audits
- Navigators catch errors BEFORE filing
- Builds taxpayer confidence

WHEN TO REVIEW
Recommended: All FSA returns before e-filing
Required: If taxpayer requests review

REVIEW METHODS
1. Virtual (Screen Share): Taxpayer shares screen, navigator watches
2. In-Person: Taxpayer brings printed return to site
3. Async (Email): Taxpayer emails PDF, navigator reviews offline (less secure)

NAVIGATOR QUALITY REVIEW CHECKLIST
Use this checklist for every review:

☐ SECTION 1: PERSONAL INFO
   ☐ Name spelling matches SSN card (middle initial ok to omit)
   ☐ SSN correct (9 digits, no transpositions)
   ☐ Address current (impacts refund mail/direct deposit)
   ☐ Filing status appropriate (verify Head of Household if used)

☐ SECTION 2: DEPENDENTS
   ☐ All qualifying children listed (check age, residency)
   ☐ SSN for each dependent correct
   ☐ Relationship accurate (child, stepchild, etc.)
   ☐ Months lived with you >6 (or all year)
   ☐ No dependents over-claimed (divorced parents?)

☐ SECTION 3: INCOME
   ☐ All W-2s entered (ask: "Any other jobs?")
   ☐ W-2 amounts match physical form (Box 1, 2, etc.)
   ☐ 1099 income included (interest, dividends, unemployment)
   ☐ No self-employment income (if present, refer to in-person)

☐ SECTION 4: DEDUCTIONS & ADJUSTMENTS
   ☐ Standard deduction used (unless itemizing justified)
   ☐ Student loan interest entered (if applicable, max $2,500)
   ☐ IRA/HSA contributions (if made)

☐ SECTION 5: CREDITS
   ☐ EIC calculated correctly (verify qualifying child requirements)
   ☐ Child Tax Credit accurate ($2,000 per child <17)
   ☐ Education credits (if Form 1098-T provided)
   ☐ Child care credit (if childcare costs documented)

☐ SECTION 6: TAX CALCULATION
   ☐ Federal withholding matches total of all W-2 Box 2
   ☐ State withholding correct (W-2 Box 17)
   ☐ Estimated payments entered (if made)

☐ SECTION 7: REFUND/PAYMENT
   ☐ Refund amount reasonable (not too high - verify credits)
   ☐ Direct deposit info correct (routing + account verified)
   ☐ Bank account in taxpayer's name (or joint with spouse)

REVIEW SCRIPT FOR NAVIGATORS
"Hi [Name], I'm [Navigator] with Maryland VITA. I'll review your return with you
to make sure everything looks good before you file. This will take about 15-20
minutes. Do you have your W-2s and other documents handy?"

[Work through checklist, explaining each section]

"Everything looks great! You're ready to file. Do you have any questions?"
OR
"I noticed a few small issues. Let me walk you through the corrections..."

COMMON ERRORS FOUND IN REVIEW
❌ W-2 Box 1 entered as annual salary (not actual Box 1 amount)
❌ Dependent SSN transposed (1234 instead of 1243)
❌ Filing status wrong (single instead of Head of Household)
❌ Missed Form 1099-INT (interest income)
❌ Bank account number missing digit
❌ Claimed EIC without qualifying child
❌ Forgot to include spouse's W-2 (Married Filing Jointly)

REVIEW OUTCOMES
✅ APPROVED: No errors, ready to file
   "Your return looks perfect! You can go ahead and e-file now."

⚠️ CORRECTIONS NEEDED: Minor errors found
   "I found a few things to fix. Let me show you..."
   [Guide taxpayer to make corrections, then re-check]

❌ REFER TO IN-PERSON: Too complex for FSA
   "Your tax situation is a bit more complex than FSA handles. I'd recommend
   coming in for an in-person appointment. Let me schedule that for you."

DOCUMENTATION
Log each review:
- Date/Time
- Taxpayer first name + last 4 SSN
- Outcome: Approved / Corrections / Referred
- Navigator initials

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 5: COMMUNICATION SCRIPTS FOR TAXPAYER GUIDANCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SCRIPT 1: FSA ORIENTATION (In-Person or Phone)
"Welcome to Maryland VITA Free Self-Assisted tax prep! Here's how this works:

1. You'll use TaxSlayer software to prepare your own taxes - it's free!
2. The software asks simple questions and guides you step-by-step
3. I'm here to help if you get stuck - just call or raise your hand
4. When you're done, I can review your return to make sure it's accurate
5. Then you'll e-file, and your refund should arrive in 10-21 days

Do you have your W-2s and ID? Great! Let's get you started..."

SCRIPT 2: ANSWERING "I DON'T KNOW HOW" CONCERNS
Taxpayer: "I'm not good with computers. This seems hard."

Navigator: "I completely understand. The good news is TaxSlayer is designed for
beginners - it asks plain-English questions like 'Did you have a job this year?'
You just answer yes or no, or type in numbers from your W-2. I'll show you the
first few screens, and you'll see it's easier than it looks. Plus, I'm right
here if you need help. Want to give it a try?"

SCRIPT 3: HANDLING FRUSTRATION
Taxpayer: "This is so confusing! I give up."

Navigator: "Taxes can definitely be frustrating - you're not alone in feeling
that way. Let's take a breath and tackle this one step at a time. Where did
you get stuck? [Listen] Ok, that part is tricky. Here's what that question is
really asking... [Explain simply] Does that make more sense? Let's keep going
together."

SCRIPT 4: GUIDING WITHOUT DOING
Taxpayer: "Can you just do this for me?"

Navigator: "I'd love to help, but FSA is designed for you to prepare your own
taxes so you learn the process. What I CAN do is guide you through each step.
Think of me as your coach! Right now, you're on the W-2 entry screen. Do you
see the box that says 'Add W-2'? Click that, and then we'll enter the numbers
from your form together. You're doing great!"

SCRIPT 5: COMPLEX CASE REFERRAL
Navigator: "I see you have self-employment income from your side business. That
requires some special forms that are beyond what FSA handles. I'd recommend
coming in for a free in-person appointment where a preparer can handle that for
you. It won't cost anything - still 100% free VITA. Can I schedule you for
Tuesday at 3pm?"

SCRIPT 6: QUALITY REVIEW FEEDBACK (Approved)
"I just finished reviewing your return, and everything looks perfect! You did a
great job entering all your information accurately. Your refund of $2,450 should
arrive in about 2 weeks if you e-file today. You can track it on the IRS 'Where's
My Refund' website. Congratulations on completing your taxes!"

SCRIPT 7: QUALITY REVIEW FEEDBACK (Corrections Needed)
"I reviewed your return and found a couple small things to fix - nothing major!
First, I noticed your W-2 Box 1 has $28,450, but you entered $28,540. Just a
typo, easy fix. Second, you have a daughter under 17, so you qualify for the
Child Tax Credit, but it wasn't claimed. Let me show you where to add that...
[Guide corrections] Perfect! Now it's ready to file."

SCRIPT 8: POST-FILING FOLLOW-UP
"Congratulations on filing your taxes! Here's what happens next:

1. IRS will send you an email confirmation (check spam folder)
2. Your refund should arrive in 10-21 days via direct deposit
3. You can track it at irs.gov/refunds (have your SSN and refund amount ready)
4. Save a copy of your return for your records (print or PDF)
5. If you have questions, call us back at 1-800-MD-TAXES

Great job, and thank you for using Maryland VITA!"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 6: ESCALATION PROCEDURES FOR COMPLEX CASES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

NOT ALL CASES ARE FSA-APPROPRIATE
Navigators must recognize when a taxpayer needs in-person VITA instead.

AUTOMATIC REFERRAL SITUATIONS (Do Not Attempt FSA)
🚩 Self-employment income >$400 (Schedule C required)
🚩 Rental property income (Schedule E required)
🚩 Stock sales, capital gains/losses (Schedule D)
🚩 Itemized deductions (mortgage interest, charity, medical)
🚩 Foreign income or foreign accounts (FBAR, FATCA)
🚩 Prior-year issues (IRS notices, audit, identity theft)
🚩 Multiple states (part-year resident, worked in 2+ states)
🚩 Business expenses (depreciation, home office)
🚩 Amended return (Form 1040-X)

ESCALATION TIERS

TIER 1: LEAD NAVIGATOR (On-Site or Available by Phone)
When to escalate:
- Complex tax question beyond your knowledge
- Software glitch or error
- Taxpayer dispute/complaint
- Uncertain if case is FSA-appropriate

Example: "I have a taxpayer with unemployment income AND a small 1099-NEC for
$300. Is that FSA-eligible or should they go in-person?"

Lead Navigator Response: Review situation, make call, provide guidance

TIER 2: SITE COORDINATOR
When to escalate:
- System-wide technical failure (internet down, TaxSlayer outage)
- Taxpayer safety concern (threatening, distressed)
- Volunteer/staff issue (navigator absent, inadequate staffing)
- Policy question (can we serve non-Maryland residents?)

Example: "All workstations lost internet - 5 taxpayers waiting. What do we do?"

Coordinator Response: Emergency troubleshooting, reschedule taxpayers, IT support

TIER 3: IRS/TAXSLAYER/MARYLAND VITA SUPPORT
When to escalate:
- Critical software bug affecting many taxpayers
- Suspected fraud or identity theft
- Legal/compliance question (SIDN usage, data breach)
- Unresolved technical issue

Example: "TaxSlayer is rejecting all Maryland state e-files with error code 9876."

Support Response: Technical fix, workaround guidance, escalate to vendor

ESCALATION DOCUMENTATION
When escalating, provide:
1. Taxpayer situation (no PII, just scenario description)
2. What you tried already
3. Why you need help (beyond your knowledge, technical issue, etc.)
4. Urgency level (immediate, same-day, can wait)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 7: NAVIGATOR SELF-CARE & PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

AVOIDING BURNOUT
FSA support can be emotionally taxing. Protect yourself:

✓ Take Breaks: 10 minutes every hour, 30 min lunch (don't skip!)
✓ Set Boundaries: No personal contact info to taxpayers
✓ Debrief Tough Cases: Talk to lead navigator after stressful interactions
✓ Rotate Tasks: Mix phone support, in-person, and quality review
✓ Know Your Limits: It's ok to say "I need help with this" and escalate

WARNING SIGNS YOU NEED A BREAK
- Feeling irritable with taxpayers
- Making careless mistakes
- Dreading your shift
- Physical exhaustion (headache, back pain)

Action: Tell coordinator, reduce hours, take a day off

CONTINUING EDUCATION
Stay sharp throughout tax season:
- Weekly team meetings: Share common issues, learn from each other
- TaxSlayer webinars: New features, tax law changes
- IRS VITA updates: Link & Learn, Volunteer Alerts
- Peer shadowing: Observe experienced navigators

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
APPENDIX: QUICK REFERENCE CARDS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

W-2 BOX CHEAT SHEET
Box 1: Wages, tips = What you earned (taxable income)
Box 2: Federal tax withheld = Amount sent to IRS from paychecks
Boxes 3/5: Social Security/Medicare wages (usually same as Box 1)
Boxes 4/6: Social Security/Medicare tax withheld
Box 15: State (MD)
Box 16: State wages (usually same as Box 1)
Box 17: State tax withheld

FILING STATUS DECISION TREE
Married on Dec 31? → Yes → Married Filing Jointly (or Separately)
                    → No ↓
Unmarried + Qualifying Dependent + Paid >50% home? → Yes → Head of Household
                                                    → No → Single

EARNED INCOME CREDIT (EIC) ELIGIBILITY QUICK CHECK
Must Have:
✓ Earned income (W-2 wages, self-employment)
✓ AGI under limit (varies by # children)
✓ Valid SSN for self, spouse, qualifying children
✓ U.S. citizen or resident alien all year
✓ No foreign income
✓ Investment income <$10,300

AGI Limits (2024):
- No children: $17,640 (single), $24,210 (married)
- 1 child: $46,560 (single), $53,120 (married)
- 2 children: $52,918 (single), $59,478 (married)
- 3+ children: $56,838 (single), $63,398 (married)

DIRECT DEPOSIT BANK ACCOUNT VERIFICATION
Routing Number: 9 digits (bottom left of check, first set of numbers)
Account Number: Varies (bottom middle of check, second set)
Account Type: Checking vs Savings (ask taxpayer - most common is checking)

Common Mistakes:
❌ Using check number instead of account number
❌ Transposing routing number digits
❌ Account not in taxpayer's name (must be their own or joint)
