FSA BEST PRACTICES GUIDE v1.0
Maryland VITA Program - Free Self-Assisted Tax Preparation
Last Updated: October 2025
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

This guide provides proven strategies for VITA sites offering Free Self-Assisted
(FSA) tax preparation, including taxpayer screening, remote support protocols,
quality assurance, and troubleshooting common challenges.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 1: WHEN TO RECOMMEND FSA vs IN-PERSON VITA
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

IDEAL FSA CANDIDATES (Encourage Self-Prep)
✓ Income $67,000 or less (IRS VITA threshold)
✓ W-2 wage income only (no self-employment)
✓ Standard deduction (not itemizing)
✓ Single or married filing jointly (simple filing status)
✓ Basic dependents (children, no complex custody)
✓ Comfortable with computers and online forms
✓ Has reliable internet access
✓ Strong English literacy (or language support available)
✓ Organized documents (W-2s, 1099s ready)
✓ Motivated to learn about their taxes

RECOMMEND IN-PERSON VITA (Higher Complexity)
⚠ Self-employment or business income (Schedule C)
⚠ Rental property income (Schedule E)
⚠ Stock sales, capital gains/losses (Schedule D)
⚠ Itemized deductions (mortgage interest, charity, medical)
⚠ Multiple states or foreign income
⚠ Complex family situations (divorce, custody, support)
⚠ Prior year issues or IRS notices
⚠ Limited computer skills or no internet access
⚠ Language barriers without translation support
⚠ Special credits requiring documentation (education, adoption)

SCREENING QUESTIONS AT INTAKE:
1. "What types of income did you receive?" (W-2, 1099, self-employment?)
2. "Will you take the standard deduction or itemize?" (Most don't itemize)
3. "How comfortable are you using a computer?" (Scale 1-5)
4. "Do you have internet access at home?" (If no, offer on-site FSA)
5. "Have you filed taxes before? Any IRS letters?" (Prior issues?)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 2: REMOTE SUPPORT PROTOCOLS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

COMMUNICATION CHANNELS
Phone Support: Primary method for quick questions
- Toll-free number: 1-800-MD-TAXES (1-800-638-2937)
- Answer within 3 rings during posted hours
- Professional greeting: "Maryland VITA FSA Support, this is [Name]. How can I help you today?"

Video/Screen Sharing: For complex issues requiring visual guidance
- Platforms: Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Google Meet
- Schedule 30-minute slots to avoid rushing
- Send calendar invite with meeting link in advance
- Test screen sharing before taxpayer session

Email Support: For non-urgent questions or document review
- Response time: Within 4 hours during business hours
- Use secure email for any tax documents (encrypted)
- Template responses for common questions (see Appendix)

REMOTE SUPPORT BEST PRACTICES
✓ Build Rapport First
   - "Thank you for using FSA! I'm here to help."
   - Ask open-ended questions: "What step are you working on?"
   - Patience is key - many taxpayers are nervous about taxes

✓ Active Listening
   - Paraphrase their concern: "So you're unsure about entering your W-2 Box 1?"
   - Avoid jargon - use plain language: "gross income" = "total pay before taxes"
   - Let them finish speaking before jumping in

✓ Guide, Don't Do
   - "Let me walk you through it" (not "let me do it for you")
   - Ask: "Do you see the button that says 'Add W-2'?" (interactive)
   - Empower them: "You're doing great! That's exactly right."

✓ Screen Sharing Etiquette
   - Ask permission: "Would you mind sharing your screen so I can see what you see?"
   - Respect privacy: "I'll only look at the tax form, not other windows"
   - Annotate carefully: Use screen pointer/arrows, not mouse control
   - End sharing when done: "You can stop sharing now, thank you!"

✓ Document Interactions
   - Log each support session: Date, time, issue, resolution
   - Note if follow-up needed or complex case flagged
   - Track common issues for training improvements

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 3: QUALITY REVIEW PROCEDURES FOR SELF-PREPARED RETURNS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

All FSA returns should undergo quality review BEFORE filing (taxpayer's choice).

QUALITY REVIEW CHECKLIST
Navigator should verify:

☐ TAXPAYER INFORMATION
   ☐ Name spelling matches SSN card
   ☐ SSN entered correctly (no transpositions)
   ☐ Address current and complete (impacts refund)
   ☐ Bank account/routing numbers accurate (if direct deposit)

☐ FILING STATUS
   ☐ Appropriate for marital status on Dec 31
   ☐ Head of Household requirements met (if used)
   ☐ Married Filing Separately justified (if applicable)

☐ DEPENDENTS
   ☐ All qualifying children/relatives listed
   ☐ SSNs correct for each dependent
   ☐ Relationship and months lived together accurate
   ☐ No double-claiming (divorced parents, etc.)

☐ INCOME
   ☐ All W-2s entered (cross-check with copies)
   ☐ Box amounts match (Wages, Federal/State withholding)
   ☐ 1099 income included (INT, DIV, MISC, NEC, etc.)
   ☐ Unemployment, Social Security entered if applicable

☐ DEDUCTIONS & ADJUSTMENTS
   ☐ Standard vs Itemized choice correct
   ☐ Student loan interest deduction (if applicable)
   ☐ IRA/HSA contributions verified
   ☐ Educator expenses (if teacher, up to $300)

☐ CREDITS
   ☐ Earned Income Credit (EIC) calculated correctly
   ☐ Child Tax Credit / Other Dependent Credit verified
   ☐ Education credits (AOTC, LLC) with Form 1098-T
   ☐ Child & Dependent Care Credit (if childcare costs)

☐ TAX CALCULATION
   ☐ Federal tax withheld matches W-2 total
   ☐ State tax withheld accurate
   ☐ Estimated payments entered (if made)
   ☐ Prior year overpayment applied (if applicable)

☐ FINAL CHECKS
   ☐ Refund/balance due amount reasonable
   ☐ Direct deposit info verified (if refund)
   ☐ Payment plan setup (if balance due)
   ☐ No math errors flagged by software

REVIEW DELIVERY METHODS
1. Virtual Review (most common):
   - Taxpayer shares screen via Zoom/Teams
   - Navigator walks through return page by page
   - Takes 20-30 minutes on average

2. Appointment Review:
   - Taxpayer brings printed return to site
   - Navigator reviews in person
   - Good for complex cases or elderly taxpayers

3. Email Review (use cautiously):
   - Taxpayer emails PDF of return (password-protected)
   - Navigator reviews and calls with feedback
   - Only for simple returns, no sensitive data via email

QUALITY ASSURANCE OUTCOMES
✓ APPROVED: Return is accurate, ready to file
   - Navigator signs off (digital signature or log entry)
   - Taxpayer proceeds to e-file

⚠ MINOR CORRECTIONS: Small issues found
   - Navigator explains corrections needed
   - Taxpayer makes changes, then re-submits for quick check

❌ REFER TO IN-PERSON: Return too complex for FSA
   - Politely explain limitations: "Your situation needs specialized help"
   - Schedule in-person VITA appointment
   - Transfer case notes to in-person preparer

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 4: DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

☐ Prior year tax return (helpful, not required)
☐ Bank account info for direct deposit (routing & account number)

Additional Documents (as applicable):
☐ 1098 forms (mortgage interest, student loan interest, tuition)
☐ Childcare provider info (name, address, EIN or SSN)

☐ IRA/retirement contribution receipts
☐ Proof of estimated tax payments
☐ IRS letters or notices (if applicable)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 5: COMMON ISSUES & TROUBLESHOOTING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ISSUE 1: TaxSlayer FSA Login Problems
Symptoms: Taxpayer can't log in, forgot password, account locked
Solutions:
✓ Verify they're using FSA link with SIDN (not regular TaxSlayer)
✓ Check email for account activation link (may be in spam)
✓ Reset password via "Forgot Password" (use personal email)
✓ If account locked: Contact TaxSlayer support 1-706-922-6741
✓ Create new account if persistent issues (use different email)

ISSUE 2: Missing or Incorrect W-2 Information
Symptoms: W-2 amounts don't make sense, boxes blank, employer name wrong
Solutions:
✓ Ask taxpayer to physically look at W-2 (not memory)
✓ Box 1 (Wages) should match or be less than gross pay
✓ Box 2 (Federal tax withheld) check paystubs match annual total
✓ If W-2 incorrect: Employer must issue corrected W-2c
✓ If employer won't provide W-2: File Form 4852 (Substitute W-2)

ISSUE 3: Dependents Not Qualifying
Symptoms: EIC or CTC denied, "dependent already claimed" error
Solutions:
✓ Verify relationship: Child, stepchild, sibling, etc.
✓ Check residency: Lived with taxpayer >6 months (or all year)
✓ Age limits: Child <17 for CTC, <19 (or <24 if student) for EIC
✓ Support test: Taxpayer provided >50% support
✓ If claimed elsewhere: May need IRS Form 8862 (prior EIC disallowance)

ISSUE 4: Maryland State Tax Issues
Symptoms: State refund much different than expected, county tax confusion
Solutions:
✓ Verify correct Maryland county (impacts local tax rate)
✓ Part-year residents: Prorate income to Maryland months
✓ State withholding on W-2: Box 17 (check for multiple states)
✓ Maryland credits: Earned Income, Child Tax, Poverty Level
✓ If discrepancy: Recalculate manually or consult tax table

ISSUE 5: Direct Deposit Errors
Symptoms: Refund delayed, sent to wrong account, check issued instead
Solutions:
✓ Double-check routing number (9 digits, first digit 0-1-2-3)
✓ Account number (savings vs checking - clarify with taxpayer)
✓ Account in taxpayer's name (joint account ok if spouse)
✓ No prepaid cards (Netspend, etc. - may be rejected)
✓ If error after filing: IRS will mail check (can't change direct deposit)

ISSUE 6: Taxpayer Overwhelmed or Frustrated
Symptoms: "This is too confusing", wants to give up, anxious
Solutions:
✓ Empathize: "I understand, taxes can be stressful. Let's take it step by step."
✓ Simplify: Break into small tasks: "Let's just enter your W-2 first, then we'll move on."
✓ Offer break: "Would you like to save and come back tomorrow?"
✓ Transition to in-person: "It might be easier if you come to our site. Would you prefer that?"
✓ Celebrate progress: "You've already completed the hardest part!"

ISSUE 7: Software Glitches or Errors
Symptoms: TaxSlayer freezes, errors submitting, calculations wrong
Solutions:
✓ Clear browser cache and cookies, restart browser
✓ Try different browser (Chrome if using Edge, etc.)
✓ Check internet connection stability
✓ Log out and log back in
✓ Screenshot error message, report to TaxSlayer support
✓ If critical bug: Switch taxpayer to in-person as workaround

ESCALATION PROCEDURES
When to escalate beyond navigator support:

⬆ TIER 1 (Lead Navigator): Complex tax questions, software bugs
⬆ TIER 2 (Site Coordinator): Taxpayer complaints, system-wide issues
⬆ TIER 3 (IRS/TaxSlayer): Technical failures, compliance questions
⬆ EMERGENCY (Coordinator): Data breach, taxpayer distress, legal issues

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 6: NAVIGATOR WELL-BEING & BURNOUT PREVENTION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FSA support can be intense during peak season. Protect navigator mental health:

✓ Limit Consecutive Sessions: Max 3-4 support calls/hours without break
✓ Rotate Difficult Cases: Share challenging taxpayers across team
✓ Debrief After Hard Calls: Talk to supervisor if emotionally taxing
✓ Set Boundaries: No personal phone numbers to taxpayers
✓ Encourage Breaks: 10 min every hour, 30 min lunch (enforced!)
✓ Recognize Volunteers: Thank navigators weekly, celebrate milestones
✓ End-of-Season Appreciation: Party, certificates, LinkedIn recommendations

Warning Signs of Burnout:
- Irritability with taxpayers
- Mistakes increasing
- Dreading shifts
- Physical exhaustion

Response: Reduce hours, provide backup, or reassign to non-taxpayer tasks.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 7: SUCCESS METRICS & CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Track these metrics to evaluate FSA program effectiveness:

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (KPIs)
□ Total FSA returns started (SIDN tracking)
□ Total FSA returns successfully filed
□ Completion rate: Filed ÷ Started (target: >80%)
□ Navigator intervention rate: % needing help (benchmark: 40-60%)
□ Average support time per taxpayer (target: <30 min)
□ Quality review pass rate (target: >90%)
□ Referrals to in-person (should be <20% of total)
□ Taxpayer satisfaction (post-filing survey, target: >4.5/5)

CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
✓ Weekly Team Meetings: Share common issues, update FAQs
✓ Mid-Season Review: Analyze metrics, adjust processes
✓ Post-Season Retrospective: "What worked? What didn't?"
✓ Training Updates: Add new scenarios based on real cases
✓ Technology Upgrades: Better screen-sharing tools, chatbots, etc.
