FSA REMOTE SUPPORT PLAYBOOK v1.0
Maryland VITA Program - Free Self-Assisted Tax Preparation
Last Updated: October 2025
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

This playbook provides detailed protocols for navigators providing remote
support to FSA taxpayers via phone, video, email, and screen sharing, including
troubleshooting guides, conversion criteria, and documentation procedures.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 1: PHONE SUPPORT BEST PRACTICES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SETTING UP PHONE SUPPORT
Equipment Needed:
✓ Headset with microphone (hands-free for note-taking)
✓ Computer with TaxSlayer access (to reference software)
✓ Call logging system (spreadsheet or CRM)
✓ Quiet environment (minimal background noise)

Phone System:
- Toll-free number: 1-800-MD-TAXES (1-800-638-2937)
- Call forwarding to navigator cell (if mobile support)
- Voicemail with expected response time
- Call recording (optional, with notice: "This call may be recorded for training")

ANSWERING THE CALL
Professional Greeting (within 3 rings):
"Good [morning/afternoon], Maryland VITA FSA support, this is [Your Name]. How
can I help you with your taxes today?"

Avoid:
❌ "Yeah?" or "Hello?"
❌ Eating/drinking during call
❌ Putting caller on hold without asking permission

ACTIVE LISTENING TECHNIQUES
✓ Let taxpayer finish speaking before responding
✓ Paraphrase to confirm understanding:
   "So you're having trouble entering your W-2, is that right?"
✓ Ask open-ended questions:
   "Can you describe what's on your screen right now?"
✓ Avoid interrupting, even if you know the answer
✓ Take notes (helps you remember and document)

TROUBLESHOOTING WITHOUT SEEING SCREEN
Challenge: Taxpayer describes what they see, but you can't visualize it.

Strategies:
1. Mirror on Your Screen
   "I'm going to open TaxSlayer on my end so we're looking at the same thing.
   Are you on the page that says 'Enter W-2 Information'? Ok, I see it too."

2. Use Specific Landmarks
   "Do you see a blue button in the bottom right corner? What does it say?"
   (Not: "Click the button" - too vague)

3. Step-by-Step Narration
   "I want you to click 'Personal Information' on the left sidebar. Do you see
   that? Great. Now look in the main area - is your name showing correctly?"

4. Patience with Technology Novices
   "Let's go slowly. Move your mouse to the top left corner of the screen.
   Do you see the word 'File'? That's a menu..."

COMMON PHONE SUPPORT SCENARIOS

SCENARIO 1: "I can't log in"
Questions to ask:
- "Are you using the FSA link we provided, or the regular TaxSlayer website?"
  (Common mistake: wrong URL)
- "What happens when you try to log in? Do you get an error message?"
- "Did you create an account already, or is this your first time?"
- "Can you check your email for the account activation link?"

Solutions:
✓ Send correct FSA link via email (with SIDN)
✓ Password reset via "Forgot Password"
✓ Check spam folder for activation email
✓ If persistent: Create new account with different email

SCENARIO 2: "I don't understand this question"
Example: "It's asking 'Did you make any estimated tax payments?' I don't know
what that means."

Response:
"Great question! Estimated tax payments are when you send money to the IRS
ahead of time during the year, usually if you're self-employed or have
investment income. Did you mail any checks to the IRS or pay online on IRS.gov
during 2024?"
[Taxpayer: No]
"Then just click 'No' for that question. Most people who have jobs don't make
estimated payments - it's automatically taken from your paycheck."

Key: Explain in plain language, relate to their situation

SCENARIO 3: "My refund seems wrong"
Taxpayer: "It says I'm getting $4,500 back. That seems too high!"

Questions:
- "How many children do you have?" (Child Tax Credit)
- "Did you work all year?" (income level affects Earned Income Credit)
- "What was your total income from all jobs?"

Response:
"Let me help you check. A $4,500 refund could be right if you have 2 kids and
earned around $30,000. You'd get the Earned Income Credit plus Child Tax Credit.
But let's double-check your W-2 entries to make sure everything is accurate.
Would you be able to share your screen so I can take a look?"

→ Transition to video/screen share for verification

HANDLING DIFFICULT CALLS

SCENARIO: Frustrated/Angry Taxpayer
"This is ridiculous! I've been trying for an hour and nothing works!"

Response (Calm, Empathetic):
"I'm really sorry you're having a frustrating experience. Taxes can be stressful,
and technical issues make it worse. I'm here to help you get through this. Let's
take a step back - can you tell me where you're stuck, and we'll solve it
together?"

✓ Acknowledge emotion: "I understand your frustration"
✓ Apologize (even if not your fault): "I'm sorry this has been difficult"
✓ Focus on solution: "Let's fix this together"
✓ Offer alternative if needed: "If this isn't working, would you prefer to come
  in for an in-person appointment?"

SCENARIO: Taxpayer Expects You to Do It For Them
"Can you just log in and do it for me? I'll give you my password."

Response (Firm but Kind):
"I appreciate your trust, but for security reasons, I can't log into your account.
Plus, the whole point of FSA is for you to prepare your own taxes so you
understand them. What I CAN do is guide you through every single step - it's
like I'm sitting next to you. I promise, it's easier than it seems! Where are
you stuck right now?"

✓ Do NOT accept passwords or log in as taxpayer (IRS violation)
✓ Redirect to coaching role
✓ Offer to stay on phone as long as needed

ENDING THE CALL
Summarize and Confirm Next Steps:
"Ok, so we fixed the W-2 entry issue, and you're going to continue entering your
other W-2. Once you're done, call us back at this number and we'll do a quality
review before you file. Does that sound good? Do you have any other questions?
...Great! Good luck, and we're here if you need us!"

Follow-Up (if needed):
"I'm going to send you an email with the link and a summary of what we discussed.
Check your inbox in about 5 minutes."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 2: VIDEO SUPPORT & SCREEN SHARING PROTOCOLS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

VIDEO PLATFORMS
Recommended: Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet
- Free accounts available
- Screen sharing built-in
- Recording option (with consent)
- Mobile-friendly (taxpayers can join from phone)

SCHEDULING VIDEO SESSIONS
Appointment-Based (Preferred):
- Taxpayer calls/emails to request video support
- Navigator sends calendar invite with meeting link
- 30-minute time slots (allows buffer between sessions)
- Reminder sent 1 hour before appointment

Walk-In Video (On-Demand):
- Taxpayer calls, navigator starts video immediately
- Good for urgent issues
- May have wait time if navigators busy

STARTING THE VIDEO SESSION
Navigator Setup (Before Taxpayer Joins):
✓ Test camera and microphone
✓ Professional appearance (visible to taxpayer)
✓ Neutral background (or virtual background)
✓ Close unnecessary tabs/programs (privacy)
✓ Have TaxSlayer open in separate window (for reference)

Greeting (When Taxpayer Joins):
"Hi [Name], thanks for joining! Can you see and hear me ok? Great. I'm [Navigator]
with Maryland VITA, and I'm here to help you with FSA. Before we start, I want
to let you know that for quality purposes, this session may be recorded - is that
ok with you? [Consent] Perfect. Can you share your screen so I can see TaxSlayer?"

SCREEN SHARING BEST PRACTICES

TAXPAYER SHARES THEIR SCREEN (Most Common)
Why: Taxpayer maintains control, navigator sees exactly what they see

How to Guide:
1. "Look at the bottom of your Zoom window - do you see a button that says
   'Share Screen'? Click that."
2. "Now you'll see all your open windows. Click on the TaxSlayer window, then
   click the blue 'Share' button at the bottom."
3. "Perfect! I can see your screen now. You still have control - I'll tell you
   what to click."

Privacy Protection:
- "Before you share, close any windows with personal info you don't want me to
  see - like your email or bank account."
- "I'll only look at the TaxSlayer window - if you need to check something else,
  you can stop sharing."

NAVIGATOR SHARES THEIR SCREEN (Educational)
When: Demonstrating how to do something step-by-step

Example:
"I'm going to share my screen and show you how to enter a W-2. Watch what I do,
then you'll do the same on your screen. Ready?"
[Navigator shares, demonstrates]
"Ok, now it's your turn. Stop my sharing and share yours, then try what I just
showed you."

ANNOTATING DURING SCREEN SHARE
Tools: Pointer, arrows, highlights (Zoom annotation features)

✓ Use pointer to indicate where to click: "See where my arrow is pointing?"
✓ Highlight text: "I'm circling the Box 1 amount - that's what you enter"
✓ Avoid taking control of taxpayer's mouse (let them click)

TROUBLESHOOTING SCREEN SHARE ISSUES
Problem: "I don't see the 'Share Screen' button"
Solution: Taxpayer may need to grant permissions, or update Zoom/Teams app

Problem: Screen is frozen or laggy
Solution: Check internet connection, close other programs, reduce video quality

Problem: Taxpayer uncomfortable sharing screen (privacy concern)
Solution: "No problem! We can do this over the phone. Just describe what you see,
and I'll guide you verbally."

CONDUCTING QUALITY REVIEW VIA VIDEO
Process:
1. Taxpayer shares screen showing TaxSlayer "Review" page
2. Navigator goes through quality review checklist (see Navigator Training)
3. Taxpayer scrolls through each section (Personal Info, Income, Credits, etc.)
4. Navigator verifies accuracy: "Your name looks good. SSN correct? Great."
5. If errors found: "Let's go back to the W-2 section and fix that typo"
6. Final approval: "Everything looks perfect! You're ready to e-file."

Time: 15-20 minutes for average return

ENDING VIDEO SESSION
"We're all set! You can stop sharing your screen now. Do you know how to e-file,
or do you want me to walk you through that too?"
[If they need help filing: Stay on call]
[If they're good: End call]

"Great job today! You should receive your refund in 10-21 days. Save a copy of
your return for your records. If you have any questions, call us back at
1-800-MD-TAXES. Take care!"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 3: TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON FSA ISSUES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ISSUE 1: SOFTWARE WON'T CALCULATE REFUND
Symptoms: "It says 'calculating...' but nothing happens" or "Refund shows $0"

Diagnosis:
- Missing information (red flags on sidebar)
- Income not entered
- Browser issue (cache, outdated version)

Solution:
1. "Let's check if all sections are complete. Do you see any red marks or
   exclamation points on the left sidebar?"
2. "Click 'Review' at the bottom - it will highlight what's missing"
3. If nothing missing: "Try refreshing the page (F5) or log out and back in"
4. If still broken: "Let's try a different browser - do you have Chrome or Edge?"

ISSUE 2: E-FILE REJECTED BY IRS
Common Rejection Codes:
- IND-031: SSN already used on another return (identity theft or duplicate filing)
- F1040-502: Dependent claimed on another return (divorced parents)
- SEIC-F1040-502: EIC qualifying child claimed elsewhere
- IND-117: Name/SSN mismatch (doesn't match IRS records)

Solution:
1. Explain rejection: "The IRS computer rejected your return because [reason]"
2. Verify data: "Let's double-check your SSN entry - does it match your card?"
3. If identity theft suspected: "This could be ID theft. You need to file Form
   14039 with the IRS. I'll help you with that."
4. If dependent dispute: "Have you talked to your ex-spouse about who's claiming
   the kids this year? You may need to resolve that first."
5. Resubmit after fixing, or paper file if necessary

ISSUE 3: DIRECT DEPOSIT REFUND NOT ARRIVING
Timeline: 10-21 days for federal, 4-6 weeks for state

Taxpayer: "It's been 3 weeks and I haven't gotten my refund!"

Response:
1. "Let's check the status. Go to IRS.gov/refunds and enter your info"
2. Possible reasons for delay:
   - Return still processing (normal, especially if filed on paper)
   - Offset for debt (student loans, child support, back taxes)
   - Additional review needed (IRS requesting documentation)
3. If beyond 21 days with no update: "Call IRS at 1-800-829-1040 with your
   return handy. They can tell you what's happening."

ISSUE 4: TAXPAYER MADE MISTAKE AFTER FILING
"I just realized I forgot to include a W-2! I already filed!"

Solution:
- If within 3 days of filing: May be able to cancel e-file (rare)
- If already accepted: Must file Form 1040-X (Amended Return)
  "You'll need to file an amendment. That's more complex, so I recommend coming
  in for an in-person appointment. Can I schedule you?"

ISSUE 5: MARYLAND STATE RETURN ISSUES
Common Maryland-Specific Problems:
- Wrong county selected (impacts local tax rate)
- Part-year resident didn't prorate income
- State tax withheld doesn't match W-2 Box 17

Solution:
1. Verify correct county: "Which Maryland county do you live in?"
2. Check W-2 Box 15: "Does it say 'MD' or another state?"
3. If worked in multiple states: "Did you work in Maryland all year, or did you
   move partway through?"
4. If complex multi-state: "This might need in-person help. Let me transfer you
   to a specialist."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 4: WHEN TO CONVERT TO IN-PERSON APPOINTMENT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

NOT EVERY TAXPAYER IS FSA-APPROPRIATE
Navigators must recognize when remote support isn't enough.

CONVERSION CRITERIA (Refer to In-Person VITA)

COMPLEXITY INDICATORS
🚩 Self-employment income (Schedule C required)
🚩 Rental property income (Schedule E)
🚩 Stock sales / capital gains (Schedule D)
🚩 Itemized deductions (mortgage, charity, medical)
🚩 Multiple states (income in 2+ states)
🚩 Foreign income or assets
🚩 Business expenses / depreciation
🚩 Prior year issues (IRS notices, audit, identity theft)
🚩 Amended return needed (Form 1040-X)

TECHNICAL BARRIERS
🚩 Taxpayer has no computer / smartphone
🚩 No internet access at home
🚩 Severe computer illiteracy (can't use mouse, navigate)
🚩 Language barrier without translation support
🚩 Disability preventing self-prep (vision, motor skills)

EMOTIONAL/SITUATIONAL INDICATORS
🚩 Extreme tax anxiety (panic, crying, overwhelmed)
🚩 Repeated calls without progress (stuck for days)
🚩 Elderly taxpayer preferring in-person interaction
🚩 Taxpayer specifically requests in-person help

CONVERSION SCRIPT
"I want to make sure you get the best service possible. Based on what you've
described [reason], I think you'd be better served by our in-person VITA program.
A volunteer preparer will do the return for you, and it's still 100% free. Would
you like me to schedule an appointment for you?"

[If yes]
"Great! Let me find a time that works. Our nearest site is [location]. Does
[day/time] work for you? Perfect. I'll send you a confirmation email with the
address and what to bring. See you then!"

[If resistant]
"I understand you'd prefer to do it yourself. If you want to keep trying FSA,
you can, but if you get stuck again, we're here to help however works best for
you."

DOCUMENTATION
Log conversion:
- Date/time of FSA attempt
- Reason for conversion (complexity, technical, etc.)
- In-person appointment scheduled (date/time/site)
- Case notes for in-person preparer

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 5: DOCUMENTATION & FOLLOW-UP PROCEDURES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHY DOCUMENTATION MATTERS
- Continuity of care (if taxpayer calls back, next navigator has context)
- Quality assurance (supervisor can review interactions)
- IRS compliance (VITA grant reporting)
- Continuous improvement (identify common issues)

WHAT TO DOCUMENT
Every support interaction should be logged with:

Required Fields:
- Date and time of contact
- Contact method (phone, video, email)
- Taxpayer first name + last 4 of SSN (never log full SSN!)
- Issue/question summary (1-2 sentences)
- Resolution or next steps
- Navigator initials

Optional Fields (for complex cases):
- Return status (not started, in progress, filed)
- Escalation (referred to lead navigator, in-person, etc.)
- Follow-up needed (yes/no, when)

DOCUMENTATION TOOLS
Option 1: Spreadsheet (Google Sheets, Excel)
Simple format:
| Date | Time | Name (Last 4 SSN) | Issue | Resolution | Navigator |

Option 2: CRM System (Salesforce, Zoho, etc.)
- More robust tracking
- Automated follow-up reminders
- Reporting dashboards

Option 3: Paper Log (if no technology)
- Binder with daily log sheets
- Transcribe to digital weekly

SAMPLE LOG ENTRIES

Good Entry:
"3/15/2025 2:30pm | John D. (1234) | Phone | Couldn't log into FSA, forgot
password. Guided through password reset. Successfully logged in. | Navigator: SM"

Bad Entry (Too Vague):
"3/15 | Some guy called about login issue | Fixed it"

Why bad?: No time, no identifier, no details, no navigator

FOLLOW-UP PROCEDURES

WHEN TO FOLLOW UP
✓ Taxpayer said they'd call back but didn't (after 1 week)
✓ Navigator promised to send info (email link, forms)
✓ Complex case requiring multi-day assistance
✓ Quality review revealed issues - taxpayer fixing and resubmitting
✓ E-file rejected - waiting for taxpayer to resolve

FOLLOW-UP METHODS
1. Phone Call (if you have permission)
   "Hi [Name], this is [Navigator] from Maryland VITA. I wanted to check in -
   were you able to finish entering that W-2 we talked about last week?"

2. Email (preferred for non-urgent)
   Subject: Maryland VITA FSA Follow-Up
   "Hi [Name], I'm following up on your FSA tax prep. Let me know if you have
   questions or need more help. Call us at 1-800-MD-TAXES anytime!"

3. No Follow-Up (if taxpayer doesn't want it)
   Some taxpayers prefer to work independently - respect that.

RETENTION & PRIVACY
Data Retention Policy:
- Keep logs for 3 years (IRS audit requirement)
- After 3 years: Securely delete/shred

Privacy Protection:
- Never log full SSN, bank account, or other sensitive data
- Store logs in password-protected system
- Limit access to authorized navigators only
- No sharing outside VITA program

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 6: NAVIGATOR SELF-ASSESSMENT & PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ONGOING SKILL DEVELOPMENT
Remote support is a skill that improves with practice.

SELF-ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS (After Each Shift)
✓ Did I actively listen without interrupting?
✓ Did I explain things clearly in plain language?
✓ Did I maintain patience, even with difficult taxpayers?
✓ Did I escalate appropriately (not too soon, not too late)?
✓ Did I document each interaction thoroughly?

PERFORMANCE METRICS TO TRACK
- Average call duration (target: 15-20 min)
- Resolution rate (% solved on first call, target: >70%)
- Escalation rate (% referred to lead/in-person, target: <30%)
- Taxpayer satisfaction (ask: "Did I answer your question?" at end of call)

CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
✓ Weekly team debriefs: Share challenging cases, learn from peers
✓ Shadow experienced navigators: Listen to their calls, observe techniques
✓ Role-play difficult scenarios: Practice with fellow navigators
✓ Solicit feedback: Ask lead navigator to review your log entries
✓ Stay updated: Tax law changes, TaxSlayer updates, new procedures
