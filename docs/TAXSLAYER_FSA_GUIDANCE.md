# TaxSlayer Facilitated Self-Assistance (FSA) Support Guidance

## Overview

Facilitated Self-Assistance (FSA) is a flexible VITA tax preparation delivery model that empowers taxpayers to prepare their own returns with volunteer support. This guidance helps navigators assist taxpayers across three FSA delivery modes.

---

## Three FSA Delivery Modes

### 1. **Fusion Mode (Hybrid)**
Combines self-prep with in-person volunteer assistance at a VITA site.

**Process Flow:**
1. Taxpayer begins tax return preparation on site using TaxSlayer
2. Volunteer provides guidance on data entry and form navigation
3. Taxpayer enters their own information (income, deductions, credits)
4. Volunteer reviews completed return for accuracy
5. Quality review performed before e-filing
6. Taxpayer signs electronically and submits

**Navigator Role:**
- Greet taxpayers and explain the Fusion process
- Provide workspace access to TaxSlayer interface
- Offer technical assistance with form navigation
- Answer questions about tax law and deductions
- Conduct quality review before submission
- Ensure proper documentation retention

**Benefits:**
- Taxpayer learns tax preparation skills
- Reduces volunteer preparation time
- Maintains quality control with volunteer review
- Empowers taxpayers for future self-filing

---

### 2. **Stand-Alone FSA (Independent Self-Prep)**
Taxpayer prepares entire return independently with minimal volunteer intervention.

**Process Flow:**
1. Taxpayer accesses TaxSlayer platform (on-site or remotely)
2. Completes full tax return without real-time assistance
3. Submits return for volunteer quality review
4. Volunteer reviews and approves or flags issues
5. Taxpayer makes corrections if needed
6. Final approval and e-filing

**Navigator Role:**
- Provide TaxSlayer login credentials and instructions
- Offer written resources (FAQs, tax law guides)
- Be available for technical questions only
- Conduct thorough quality review post-completion
- Communicate rejection issues clearly for taxpayer correction

**Benefits:**
- Minimal volunteer time required
- Flexible completion timeline for taxpayers
- Builds taxpayer confidence and independence
- Scalable model for high-volume sites

**When to Recommend:**
- Taxpayers with simple returns (W-2 only, standard deduction)
- Repeat filers familiar with tax preparation
- Sites with limited volunteer availability
- Taxpayers who prefer independent work

---

### 3. **Remote FSA (Virtual Assistance)**
Taxpayer prepares return remotely with virtual volunteer support.

**Process Flow:**
1. Taxpayer uploads required documents via secure portal
2. Receives TaxSlayer access credentials via email
3. Prepares return from home/mobile device
4. Schedules virtual appointment with volunteer if needed
5. Volunteer provides guidance via video call, phone, or secure messaging
6. Quality review conducted remotely
7. Electronic signature and e-filing

**Navigator Role:**
- Facilitate document upload process (use VITA Documents portal)
- Schedule virtual appointment using Google Calendar integration
- Provide secure messaging support for taxpayer questions
- Conduct remote quality review using screen-sharing tools
- Guide taxpayers through e-signature process
- Ensure document security and proper retention

**Technology Requirements:**
- Stable internet connection
- Device with web browser (laptop, tablet, smartphone)
- Email access for credentials and notifications
- Video call capability (for synchronous support)
- Secure document upload capability

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates transportation barriers
- Accommodates work schedules and disabilities
- Expands geographic reach beyond physical site
- Maintains VITA quality standards remotely

**When to Recommend:**
- Taxpayers without transportation access
- Working individuals who can't visit sites during business hours
- Rural communities far from VITA locations
- Taxpayers with mobility or health limitations

## Navigator Support Guidelines

### Initial Taxpayer Assessment
Determine appropriate FSA mode based on:
- **Tax Return Complexity**: Simple (W-2 only) vs. Complex (self-employment, investments)
- **Taxpayer Comfort Level**: First-time filer vs. experienced
- **Technology Access**: On-site computer vs. home device
- **Time Availability**: Same-day completion vs. flexible timeline
- **Language/Accessibility Needs**: In-person support vs. remote assistance

### Recommended FSA Mode by Scenario

| Taxpayer Profile | Recommended Mode | Rationale |
|-----------------|------------------|-----------|
| First-time filer, simple W-2 | **Fusion** | Hands-on learning with safety net |
| Repeat filer, standard deduction | **Stand-Alone** | Independence with quality check |
| Rural resident, no transportation | **Remote** | Eliminates travel barrier |
| Working professional, complex return | **Fusion** or **Remote** | Real-time support for complexity |
| Limited English proficiency | **Fusion** | In-person language assistance |
| Disability/mobility limitation | **Remote** | Accommodates accessibility needs |

### Quality Review Checklist (All FSA Modes)

Before approving any FSA return, verify:

- [ ] All income sources reported (W-2s, 1099s, gig economy)
- [ ] Filing status correctly selected
- [ ] Dependents claimed with valid SSNs and relationships
- [ ] Tax credits accurately calculated (EITC, CTC, education credits)
- [ ] Deductions properly substantiated
- [ ] Bank account information correct for direct deposit
- [ ] Prior year AGI matches (for identity verification)
- [ ] Taxpayer signature obtained electronically

**Rejection Scenarios:**
- Mathematical errors in calculations
- Missing required forms or schedules
- Inconsistent income reporting
- Invalid dependent claims
- Unsupported deductions

## Maryland-Specific FSA Considerations

### State Tax Integration
- Maryland Form 502 automatically populated from federal return
- County tax rates applied based on residence
- State EITC calculated (50% of federal EITC)
- Pension subtraction limits enforced ($36,200 for 2024)

### Cross-Enrollment Intelligence
After tax preparation, check for unclaimed benefits:
- **SNAP** - If AGI < 200% FPL and household has low assets
- **Medicaid** - If uninsured and AGI < 138% FPL (childless adults) or 215% FPL (families)
- **OHEP** - If utility costs > 10% of household income
- **Tax Credits** - Homeowners' or Renters' Property Tax Credit eligibility

**Navigator Action:** After FSA return completion, use Benefit Screener to identify missed opportunities and facilitate cross-enrollment.

## Documentation & Compliance

### Required FSA Documentation
- Intake & Interview Sheet (Form 13614-C)
- Quality Review Record (Form 8879 or equivalent)
- Consent Form (IRS Publication 4299 compliance)
- Document checklist with verification dates
- Communication log (for Remote FSA)

### IRS Compliance Standards
- All FSA returns subject to same quality standards as traditional VITA
- Volunteer certification required (Basic, Advanced, or Military)
- Scope limitations: Cannot prepare returns with >$66,000 AGI (2024)
- Link and Learn Taxes refresher annually

### Data Security

## Common FSA Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Taxpayer Overwhelmed During Self-Prep
**Solution:** Switch to Fusion mode mid-process. Navigator can take over data entry while explaining each step, then transition back to taxpayer control.

### Challenge: Technical Issues with TaxSlayer Platform
**Solution:** 
- Ensure browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari latest versions)
- Clear cache and cookies
- Use incognito/private browsing mode
- Escalate to site coordinator if persistent

### Challenge: Quality Review Identifies Errors in Stand-Alone/Remote FSA
**Solution:**
- Use secure messaging to explain corrections needed
- Schedule follow-up virtual appointment if complex
- Provide annotated screenshots highlighting issues
- Offer to convert to Fusion mode for correction assistance

### Challenge: Taxpayer Abandons Remote FSA Mid-Return
**Solution:**
- Send reminder email at 48 hours
- Offer phone call to troubleshoot barriers
- Provide deadline extension if reasonable
- Transition to in-person appointment if feasible
