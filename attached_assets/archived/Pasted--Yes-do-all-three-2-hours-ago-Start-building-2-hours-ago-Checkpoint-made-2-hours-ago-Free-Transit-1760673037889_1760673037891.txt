We use something called Qless for scheduling appointments find information on that system if you can for integration. Don't build closer to e-filing as that requires approval but build out the VITA component rules engines and VITA workflow with TaxSlayer integration or data entry support. Do all category 2. Ingest this information and then regenerate a new list of updated categories of features

I wanted you to pause and review this documentation as it directly relates to the version of text Slayer that volunteers use.

https://cashmd.org/wp-content/uploads/Pro-Online-Support-Guide.pdf

Determine if you can find a more up-to-date version as well, but if not, continue to use this one and propose new tasks to build into the existing workstream. If you think any are warranted with information gained from having this this support guide.

Then represent the work stream you're currently paused within with those updated tasks. If you have added any

I'll review the TaxSlayer Pro Online Support Guide and search for any newer versions. Let me fetch the document and see what insights we can gain for the VITA workflow.

Excellent! I found a more recent official version. IRS Publication 5361 (Rev. 8-2025) is the official TaxSlayer Pro Online guidance for VITA/TCE programs, which is more current than the Cash MD guide. Let me fetch it:

Perfect! I found IRS Publication 5361 (Rev. 8-2025) - this is the most current official TaxSlayer Pro guidance for VITA/TCE programs, updated August 2025. This is more recent than the Cash MD guide.

Key Insights from TaxSlayer Documentation
After reviewing the official IRS guidance, I've identified several important TaxSlayer features that we should integrate into our VITA workflow:

Currently Missing Features:
Scanned Document Program Simulation

TaxSlayer allows volunteers to scan/upload documents for storage
Documents accessible to preparers when completing returns
We should mirror this workflow with our Google Cloud Storage integration
Customer Portal Capabilities

Taxpayers can upload missing documents (images, PDFs up to 10MB)
Electronic signature capability for documents
Secure messaging for reject resolution
We could build a taxpayer self-service portal
TaxSlayer FSA (Facilitated Self Assistance) Support

Three delivery modes: Fusion, Stand-alone, Remote
Self-prep with certified volunteer assistance available
We should add guidance for navigators managing FSA sites
Prior Year Tax Return Preparation

TaxSlayer supports 5 prior years (2020-2024)
E-filing for 2 prior years (2023-2024)
We currently only support 2024
