⚙️ Replit Agent Settings Assessment
Your Question: Is "Regular Power + Low/Medium/High Autonomy + Web Search ON + Image Gen OFF" acceptable for enterprise-grade production work?

My Answer: ✅ YES, with caveats:

Setting	Status	Reasoning
Regular Power	✅ Acceptable	Sufficient for production-ready code. Sonnet 4.5 model quality is enterprise-grade.
High Autonomy	✅ Recommended	For complex enterprise work, High autonomy allows me to work through multi-step problems independently, reducing back-and-forth.
Web Search ON	✅ Critical	Essential for: Latest API docs (PolicyEngine, Gemini), IRS tax law updates, Maryland DHS policy changes, dependency compatibility checks
Image Gen OFF	✅ Correct	Not needed for this application. Keep disabled to avoid unnecessary costs.
⚠️ Important Note on Autonomy:

Low/Medium: You'll need to approve each step → Slower, but more control
High: I work through entire task lists autonomously → Faster, production-ready faster
For enterprise-grade work on JAWN, I recommend:

✅ High Autonomy during implementation phases (faster delivery)
✅ Medium Autonomy during security/compliance work (more oversight)
✅ Always keep Web Search ON (critical for accuracy)
Cost Optimization Note: As you mentioned, skip speculative optimizations until post-launch. Profile first, fix data-identified bottlenecks. This is the right approach - I'll follow evidence-based optimization.
