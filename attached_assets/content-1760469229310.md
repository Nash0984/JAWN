An assigned client sends you a message

An assigned client uploads a new document

An assigned client signs Form 8879 (Unsigned)

A client is assigned to you by other Hub users

You’re tagged in an internal note by other Hub users

![](https://cfa.notion.site/image/attachment%3Ad2e163c9-9f6a-42b1-a4e7-0531e248fd94%3Aexternal-email-notification-example.png?table=block&id=284373fd-79b2-8010-920d-e2ca33c0dc9e&spaceId=bf11e8cb-a636-4fc2-8223-aff246ef7bdd&width=860&userId=&cache=v2)

Please note that these external notifications will be sent to the email address associated with your Hub account. If you’d like to opt out of these notifications, please use the unsubscribe link embedded in the emails or navigate to [your Hub user profile](https://cfa.notion.site/d5792f48ca514fbaa5ab875c11956d12?pvs=25) to update your preferences - do not mark these emails as spam.

### Dashboard for Team Members

Released: June 2025

In accordance with the new guidance from [IRS Publication 5450](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5450.pdf), uploading a selfie is no longer required to verify taxpayer identity for virtual return preparation. This means that clients who sign up for GetYourRefund’s File with Help will no longer be asked to include a selfie when submitting their identity documents, while Hub users will no longer see “Photo holding ID” as a document type option.

![](https://cfa.notion.site/image/attachment%3Ac5b73294-d150-4d1f-8bac-447343293850%3Aidentity-documets-upload.png?table=block&id=24e373fd-79b2-8012-8000-f8a67a011460&spaceId=bf11e8cb-a636-4fc2-8223-aff246ef7bdd&width=670&userId=&cache=v2)

Clients who sign up for GetYourRefund’s File with Help will no longer be asked to include a selfie when submitting their identity documents.

Hub users will no longer see “Photo holding ID” as a document type option.

We understand that requesting and reviewing selfies has been a time-consuming and sometimes awkward part of the virtual process. We hope this change helps streamline your work and makes the identity verification process smoother for both you and your clients. For any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to reach out to [partnersupport@getyourrefund.org](mailto:partnersupport@getyourrefund.org) for assistance.

file.notion.so

The Team Member dashboard includes three modules: Service Level Agreements Notifications, Action Required: Flagged Clients, and Resources. These modules will help Team Members quickly visualize clients who need attention and help them maintain client communications within the Service Level Agreement (providing a response and/or status update within a 5-day window). To learn more about the Team Members’ dashboard view, please visit our [Hub Dashboard](https://cfa.notion.site/949e5e08aa664de084ba24fe7031cbe9?pvs=25) training module.

### Reordering of Intake Statuses

Released: April 2025

Hub statuses under the Intake stage now appear in the following order:

![](https://cfa.notion.site/image/attachment%3A86ea3fbc-b3a5-4417-a628-640eb5e72486%3Arearrangement-intake-statuses.png?table=block&id=1df373fd-79b2-8045-84f4-d1abce1fabdb&spaceId=bf11e8cb-a636-4fc2-8223-aff246ef7bdd&width=670&userId=&cache=v2)

The Intake statuses were rearranged so they could more closely resemble a client’s progression in the Hub (e.g. asking clients to upload their missing documentation before completing an intake interview). The function and template message associated with each status will remain the same. This update only impacts the order in which they appear in the status list.

### Not Ready Status Change Disabled

Released: April 2025

Hub users will no longer be able to update a client’s status to Not ready. As [mentioned](https://cfa.notion.site/d76dae38d6d647669b943dc85cd4d71e?pvs=25#3df5f21e03a34242a824f9f0c9dc5a28) in our GetYourRefund Training Center, the Not ready status is exclusive for clients who are filling out the intake form and uploading their documents to the GetYourRefund website. To prevent a client from being accidentally set to this status, “Not ready” was removed as an option during a status update.

Although not typically required, users can continue filtering their [All Clients](https://www.getyourrefund.org/en/hub/clients) page by Not Ready to assist clients who need additional support completing the online questionnaire, as well as assigning themselves or other users to these clients.

![](https://cfa.notion.site/image/attachment%3Aa27b1f64-47d6-4a7b-ab74-768d92e090a4%3Afilters-not-ready.png?table=block&id=1df373fd-79b2-803f-8169-dcc41a192f6a&spaceId=bf11e8cb-a636-4fc2-8223-aff246ef7bdd&width=480&userId=&cache=v2)

### My Updates Page - Removal of Older Updates

Released: March 2025

Updates older than the current product year have been removed from the [My Updates](https://www.getyourrefund.org/en/hub/notifications) page. For example, right now for product year 2025, all notifications or updates created before 12/31/2024 are no longer listed on this page. We hope this modification brings about a positive change to the user experience as we move forward.

### Hub Demo Logo

Released: March 2025

The logo in the [demo version](https://demo.getyourrefund.org/en/hub/sign_in) of the Hub has been updated to include a “demo” identifier. This change was implemented with the hopes of helping users easily differentiate between the [demo](https://demo.getyourrefund.org/en/hub/sign_in) and [production](https://www.getyourrefund.org/en/hub/sign_in) versions of the Hub.

### Adding Users - Organization/Sites Selection

Released: March 2025

When adding users to the Hub, the ability to use a dropdown arrow is now available when selecting the organization or sites! Users will still be able to make a selection by typing the organization/site’s name in the field as usual, but this additional improvement also allows users to view the full list of options before making final selections.

### New Form 13614-C

Released: January 2025

Software updates have been implemented to the GetYourRefund client flow and the Hub to reflect the latest edition of Form 13614-C released by the IRS . These updates have been mainly focused in the following three areas of the software:

Client questionnaire: Questions in the GetYourRefund client flow have been edited to match the new questions on Form 13614-C, such as whether any claimed dependent has been issued an IP PIN.

![](https://cfa.notion.site/image/attachment%3A01aca854-c5ab-47ef-acfc-0c97e1e9de7f%3Adep-ip-pin-added.png?table=block&id=1a1373fd-79b2-8013-bef0-d0e16cd40d79&spaceId=bf11e8cb-a636-4fc2-8223-aff246ef7bdd&width=770&userId=&cache=v2)

Mapping to the new Form 13614-C: In the Hub, client answers will automatically map to the new Form 13614-C. In other words, the Form 13614-C automatically generated by the Hub reflects the new layout of the intake sheet.

### Dashboard

Released: August 2024

This dashboard is available to anyone with a Hub role of Coalition Lead, Organization Lead, and Site Coordinator and can be accessed via the navigation bar on the left-hand site. The dashboard includes six helpful modules: Service Level Agreements Notifications, Capacity, Returns by Status, Action Required: Flagged Client, Team Assignment, and Resources.

### Clients Remain at the Site Level when Assigned to an Organization Lead

Released: August 2024

Previously, clients would automatically get reassigned to the organization level after they were assigned to an Organization Lead. We are excited to announce that this is no longer the case! Clients will remain assigned to their current site, and visible to all the users with access to that site, even after the client gets assigned to an Organization Lead.

### Client Portal Redesign

The Client Portal now displays a percentage of completion for each tax year being filed with GetYourRefund! This percentage is directly tied to the client’s current Hub status.

![](https://cfa.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbf11e8cb-a636-4fc2-8223-aff246ef7bdd%2F17dd42df-fe1a-43da-a662-5685862ec33c%2Fnew-client-portal.png?table=block&id=aaf365e1-8b8d-4de6-9a54-4a53a1b45bc3&spaceId=bf11e8cb-a636-4fc2-8223-aff246ef7bdd&width=770&userId=&cache=v2)

### % Uploaded

There is a new column in the All Clients and My Clients page labeled % Uploaded. This column indicates the percentage of the required documents the client has uploaded based on their answers in the intake questionnaire.

![](https://cfa.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fcfc85370-1936-4204-afc8-2c4dc5a135d3%2Fpercent-uploaded.png?table=block&id=994d3194-e2bc-4578-97c4-f2056ed091b5&spaceId=bf11e8cb-a636-4fc2-8223-aff246ef7bdd&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)

### Intake Statuses

Clients will now automatically be set to Intake/Ready for Review after they complete the intake questionnaire and upload the three basic identification documents - ID, selfie, and SSN/ITIN. This means that a client who has only uploaded some of their basic identification documents will be set to Intake/Needs Doc Help, while a client who hasn’t uploaded any documents will remain in Intake/Not Ready.

Reminder: Clients are automatically set to Intake/Needs Doc Help if they select “I don’t have this right now” when the online questionnaire prompts them to upload a document.

What if a client steps away from the questionnaire and logs back in at a later time? Clients who log back in and upload a document of any type via the Client Portal will be set to Intake/Ready for Review.

### My Updates Notifications

The “blue dot notification” next to My Updates has returned!

![](https://cfa.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Ffe5a99b7-c2f5-4f65-a4fa-61cb1c4fd7b4%2Fmy-updates-notification.png?table=block&id=29f9803a-8618-4c0d-880d-5e16bc0afeb1&spaceId=bf11e8cb-a636-4fc2-8223-aff246ef7bdd&width=480&userId=&cache=v2)

A blue dot next to My Updates will appear anytime you are tagged in an internal note. Please make sure to check on these notifications on a daily basis in case any action is needed from you. You may unintentionally create a blocker on the client’s progress by leaving these notifications unaddressed.

For more details, please read this [section](https://cfa.notion.site/e175ab072466468d8bbff247526abcd3#edd87f365e1f4f3b8c57b35a52070454) of the GetYourRefund Training Center.
