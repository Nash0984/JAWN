Perfect! Let me integrate web search, image generation capabilities, and a comprehensive offline demo suite into the plan.

🎯 FINAL COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATED PLAN
(With Autonomy, Power Mode, Web Search, Image Gen, & Demo Suite)

Phase 1: Foundation, Unblock & Initial Cleanup ⚡
Time: 25 mins | Autonomy: 🔵 HIGH | Power: ⚪ Standard
Web Search: ❌ Not needed | Image Gen: ❌ Not needed

1-7. [Same as before - debugging and cleanup tasks]

Phase 2: AI Engines + Multi-State Foundation 🧠
Time: 3 hours | Autonomy: 🟣 MAX | Power: 🔥 HIGH POWER
Web Search: ✅ ENABLE | Image Gen: ❌ Not needed

Why Web Search: Need to research state-specific benefit programs, eligibility criteria, and jurisdiction-specific rules for multi-state architecture. May need latest policy updates from state websites.

8-13. [Same AI engine tasks]

Phase 3: Enterprise Integration & Dashboard Consolidation 🔌
Time: 1.5 hours | Autonomy: 🔵 HIGH | Power: ⚪ Standard
Web Search: ❌ Not needed | Image Gen: ✅ ENABLE

Why Image Gen: May need placeholder charts, icons, or visual assets for Executive Analytics Dashboard.

14-19. [Same dashboard integration tasks]

Phase 4: Reliability, Governance & TODO Cleanup 🛡️
Time: 1.5 hours | Autonomy: 🟣 MAX | Power: 🔥 HIGH POWER
Web Search: ✅ ENABLE | Image Gen: ❌ Not needed

Why Web Search: Need to verify latest GDPR/CCPA compliance requirements, state-specific data retention laws, and IRS Pub 1075 guidelines.

20-25. [Same reliability/governance tasks]

Phase 5: API Platform & Developer Experience 🔌
Time: 45 mins | Autonomy: 🟢 MEDIUM | Power: ⚪ Standard
Web Search: ❌ Not needed | Image Gen: ❌ Not needed

26-29. [Same API platform tasks]

Phase 6: Performance & Query Optimization ⚡
Time: 1 hour | Autonomy: 🔵 HIGH | Power: 🔥 HIGH POWER
Web Search: ❌ Not needed | Image Gen: ❌ Not needed

30-34. [Same performance tasks]

Phase 7: UI/UX Polish 🎨
Time: 45 mins | Autonomy: 🟢 MEDIUM | Power: ⚪ Standard
Web Search: ❌ Not needed | Image Gen: ✅ ENABLE

Why Image Gen: Need placeholder images for loading states, empty states, onboarding illustrations, and demo content.

35-39. [Same UI/UX tasks]

Phase 8: Comprehensive Demo Suite 🎬 (NEW)
Time: 2 hours | Autonomy: 🔵 HIGH | Power: 🔥 HIGH POWER
Web Search: ✅ ENABLE | Image Gen: ✅ ENABLE

Why High Power: Complex demo orchestration across all features. Requires understanding entire system.
Why Web Search: May need real example data (sample benefit amounts, tax brackets, etc.)
Why Image Gen: Need sample household photos, document images, form screenshots for realistic demos.

Tasks:

Expand Static Demo Data Service
Create cached demo data for all 7 AI engines
Sample households across all 50 states (10 representative states minimum)
Multi-program scenarios (single parent + SNAP + Medicaid + EITC)
Build Offline Demo Showcase (/demo-suite)
Interactive walkthrough of all 99+ features
No API calls - 100% static/cached data
Works without internet or Gemini API
AI Engine Demos:
MAIVE: Show test runs with 95%+ accuracy validation
QC Analytics: Error patterns, risk scoring, predictions
Benefits Navigation: Hidden pathway discovery examples
Decision Points: Critical intervention moment identification
Info Cost Reduction: Policy translation samples
Multi-State Rules: Cross-jurisdiction comparisons
Enterprise Feature Demos:
Multi-tenant white-labeling (Maryland vs Virginia examples)
GDPR data export workflow
Circuit breaker failover scenarios
SLA monitoring dashboards
Webhook event logs
End-to-End User Journeys:
Applicant: Check eligibility → Apply → Upload docs → Get approved
Navigator: Client intake → Benefit calc → Cross-enrollment → Tax prep
Supervisor: QC review → Error patterns → Training assignment
Admin: Multi-state config → API keys → Compliance audit
Generate Demo Assets:
Sample household profile photos (diverse demographics)
Mock benefit letters and notices
Example tax documents (W-2s, 1099s)
Screenshot workflows for user guides
Demo Navigation & Discovery:
Search/filter demos by feature, program, or role
Category organization (AI, Benefits, Tax, QC, Admin)
Estimated time to complete each demo
Code snippets showing API usage
Deliverable: Fully offline demo suite showcasing 100% of platform capabilities
